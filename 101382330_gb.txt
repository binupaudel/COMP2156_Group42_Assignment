George Brown College is now offering a fully funded Early Childhood Education (Compressed) program for a limited time.
George Brown College students get a fully subsidised check-up and teeth cleaning with their active school dental insurance plan.  For other dental services, there may be a co-payment if they are partially subsidised. Check your student dental plan breakdown in the section below for more details.
